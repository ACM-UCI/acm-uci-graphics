# ACM@UCI Graphics

```
Let's get graphical
```

Various graphics related to ACM@UCI. The Makefile can be used to convert the
svg's into the png's stored in the `build` folder. The Makefile requires
Inkscape to be installed and available.

`email` contains an email signature that can be pasted into the gmail signature
box. Note that the image is linked to `build/logo/acm_uci_color_256.png`, so
updating the logo here automatically updates the signature as well. On the other
hand, if the image disappears from here, the logo will no longer show in the
signature.
